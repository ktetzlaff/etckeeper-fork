i'm not sure that's the right way. i think you're right in that `grep -x` doesn't do the right thing, but I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do with that extra `sed 's-^///--'` pattern there...

I have proposed another solution which you might be interested in, in [[todo/metadata_ignore_filters_do_not_work]], which is basically to stop trying to reimplement git-ignore ourselves...
