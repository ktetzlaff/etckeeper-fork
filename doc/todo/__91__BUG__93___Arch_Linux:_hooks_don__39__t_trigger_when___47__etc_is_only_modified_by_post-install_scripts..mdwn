The pacman hooks that etckeeper use only trigger if a package changes a file in /etc. This breaks when a package only changes /etc in it's post-install script.

An example of this is archlinux-keyring, which runs a post install script to update the gpg trust db in /etc/pacman.

The solution is to change the hooks to always run. Instead of:

```
Type = Path
Target = etc/*
```

use something like:

```
Type = Package
Target = *
```

At least when using git, `etckeeper pre-install` and `etckeeper post-install` are quick enough on my computer that running when not needed is not a big deal.

Here is the Arch Linux bug about this: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/76826
