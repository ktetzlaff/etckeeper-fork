You have misunderstood (and oddly, misquoted) the code.

30store-metadata already uses `git ls-files -oi --exclude-standard` to list
gitignored files. The use of grep is only to search through the resulting
list of ignored files, to find an exact match for a filename.. That is
indeed inefficient when there are a lot of ignored files. But it matches
ignored files correctly.

(30store-metadata does grep .darcsignore, I don't know if that is a good
idea.)
