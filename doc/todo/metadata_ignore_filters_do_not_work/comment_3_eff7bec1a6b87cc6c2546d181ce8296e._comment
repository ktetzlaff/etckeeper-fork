> But why do we list _all_ the ignored files in the metadata store?

It doesn't. This code is what filters those ignored files out of the ones
that are included. It's easy to show it works:

	root@darkstar:~>grep mtab /etc/.gitignore
	mtab
	mtab.fuselock
	root@darkstar:~>ls /etc/mtab
	/etc/mtab@
	root@darkstar:~>grep mtab /etc/.etckeeper
	- exit 1
	root@darkstar:~>grep adjtime /etc/.gitignore 
	adjtime
	root@darkstar:~>ls /etc/adjtime 
	/etc/adjtime
	root@darkstar:~>grep adjtime /etc/.etckeeper 
	- exit 1

You have not yet given an example of it not working.
