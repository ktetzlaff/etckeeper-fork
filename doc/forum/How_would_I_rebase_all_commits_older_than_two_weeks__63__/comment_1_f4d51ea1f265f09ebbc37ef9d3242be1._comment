Unless you have a super constrained environment like [openwrt](https://openwrt.org/) then disk usage of `/etc/.git` is completely ignorable (and even so, my openwrt router only uses 2.1Mb for `/etc/.git`, initial commit 2016). I checked all my servers and desktops and the largest was 196Mb on a machine that used to be my main desktop with the repository started in 2017.
